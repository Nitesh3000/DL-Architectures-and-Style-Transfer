# **Deep Learning Experiments**

## **Overview**
This repository contains experiments and studies on deep learning architectures and techniques, focusing on image classification and neural style transfer.

## **Projects**

### **1. Replication Study of ResNet & Inception Net**
- Analyzed the impact of **skip connections** (ResNet) and **multi-scale filters** (Inception) on feature extraction.
- Evaluated model performance on image classification tasks.

### **2. Neural Style Transfer**
- Used **pre-trained CNNs** to blend content and artistic styles from different images.
- Optimized loss functions and training methods for improved efficiency and scalability.

## **Usage**
- Clone the repository and run the provided Jupyter notebooks to explore the models and experiments.
- Modify hyperparameters and architectures to experiment with different configurations.
